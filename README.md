Fridge for Android
==================

`"Discover the FREE and easy way to a full refrigerator, and never let expired food or an empty ice box spoil your life again!"`

**Fridge** is second version of the [aFridge](https://github.com/Drakuwa/aFridge "aFridge") Android application I've published a long time ago, and it's totally rewritten from scratch, implementing some of the newest programming and design trends. Basically, the idea behind the application is the same - it keeps track of your refrigerator items, and has a convenient feature for adding and sharing notes, for example, sharing shopping lists. The application now syncs its records with a CouchDB database server from where they are distributed to its users devices, if the user decides to sign in with their Facebook/Twitter or Google+ accounts.

The application is a free software published under the [GNU GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt "GNU GPLv3") license.
